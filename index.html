        <li>IoT Website/Database/Simulator- June 2020</li>
        <p>This project's goal was to design a website that showed different measurements regarding weather 
        conditions in Mexico City, such as temperature, humidity and Co2. The purpuse of this website
        was to take note of how bad our weather conditions actually are. For this project my team and I worked with matlab, as well as  packet tracker and php myadmin for the data base.<p/>

        <h2>FETEC</h2>
        <li>Website- January 2021</li>
        <p>FETEC is the student's association in ITESM, meaning, they're in charge of solving students concerns and making events; as important as they are they didn't have an official website where someone could access thier events and keep track of what they are currently doing. This is why me and my friends decided to make one. 
        The website allows you to get in contact with FETEC members as well as checking their calender. <p/>
